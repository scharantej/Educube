## **Flask Application Design**

### **Introduction**
We will design a Flask application to create an interactive website that teaches young students in primary school additions and multiplications in a fun and engaging way.

### **HTML Files**

1. **index.html**:
   - This file will serve as the homepage of our website.
   - It will contain an introduction to the website, explaining its purpose and features.
   - It will also provide links to different sections of the website, such as addition games, multiplication games, and a section for parents and teachers.

2. **addition_games.html**:
   - This file will contain various interactive addition games.
   - It can include games like drag-and-drop puzzles, matching games, and interactive quizzes.
   - Each game will be designed to reinforce the concept of addition in a fun and entertaining way.

3. **multiplication_games.html**:
   - This file will offer a collection of engaging multiplication games.

   - These games will help students master multiplication facts while having fun.

4. **parent_teacher_section.html**:
   - This file will cater to parents and teachers who use the website.
   - It will provide resources and tips for teaching math to young students.
   - It can also include a section for parents to track their child's progress on the website.

### **Routes**

1. **@app.route('/')**:
   - This route will be mapped to the **index.html** file.
   - It will display the homepage of the website when users visit the root URL.
